# BusMall User Stories.

### Marketing Research Team (MRT)
- As a member of MRT I want the data to be as untainted as possible.  All images should be presented at the same size and results should not be displayed until the survey is finished.
- As a member of MRT I want the data to be useful. I.E. the results should show % of times an image was selected when it was an option rather than only number of times an image was selected.
- As a member of MRT I want the data to be varied. The images should not be shown twice in a row, and no set of 3 images should be repeated.
- as a member of MRT I want to make sure that once the survey has been completed (25 results) the user is no longer allowed to select further images.
- as a member of MRT I want the results to be easily read.  A bar chart would work for this.

### Focus Group User (User)
- As a user I want the layout of the site to be visually appealing and easy to read.
- As a user I want the way I interact with the site to be intuitive.  I.E. If the site instructs me to click on an image, I don't want to have to find a radio button to click on.
- As a user I want the site to give me simple and easy to follow instructions that let me know what to expect.s
- As a user I want some indication that I am about to select an image. (soemthing on :hover probably)

### Developer
- As a developer I want my code to be DRY, or at least DRYish for easy readabilty and less typing.
- As a developer I want my code to be easily expandable if more products are added.
